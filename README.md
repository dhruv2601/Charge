# How Does it Work?

Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons - Kontakt 350ms

# Encouragement through Reward System

Our unique reward system provides the user reward points for each kW of energy saved. These reward points can be exchanged for PayTM money, Uber rides and so on. Moreover, the user is not profiting but the power company is since less energy is consumed by the user. This will cut down on the shortages and cut-off of the power supply.

# Motivation

The motivation for this project was the India Smart Grid Week - 2017. Where the project was reviewed by the CEO of Tata Power Co Ltd, Mr. Praveer Sinha.
